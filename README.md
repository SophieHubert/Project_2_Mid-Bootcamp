To self-manage the project i have been using Kanban board




# Classification - Credit_card

01. **Data Cleaning**
The first step of this project was cleaning the data and saving as new file .
I choose to start by cleaning the dataset as it was easier to use to answer the queries.
- column name, removing  symbols and formating
- checking duplicates and nan values

02. **SQL Questions - Classification**
Exploring the data with Mysql
The different queries have been resolved in :
- **MYSQL:** MySQL project classification
- **Jupyter notebook:** 02- MySQL - Classification
