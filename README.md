**Background:**  I work as a Risk Analyst for a bank, which provides various banking and loan services, as well as credit card services which are a very important revenue source. 

**Objective:** Understanding the demographics and other characteristics of the bank's customers.
This study provides insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers. 
We will also look for other potential areas of opportunity.


**Data:** The data set consists of information on 18,000 current bank customers .
- `credit_card_marketing.csv`
- `credit_card_data.csv`
- `creditcardmarketing.xlsx`



The software used to analyse the data and answer the queries are:
 - Jupyter notebook
 - MYSQL
 - Tableau 


To manage the project i have been using Kanban Project Board







# Classification - Credit_card

01. **Data Cleaning**
   The first step of this project was cleaning the data and saving it as new file .
   I choose to start by cleaning the dataset as it was easier to use to answer the queries in MySQL.
   - column name, removing  symbols and formating
   - checking duplicates and nan values



02. **SQL Questions - Classification**
   Exploring the data with MySQL.
   The different queries have been resolved in :
   - **MYSQL:** MySQL project classification
   - **Jupyter notebook:** 02- MySQL - Classification






03. **Exploring the data**
   Exploring and understanding the data with jupyter notebook to prepare the data for modeling before building exploratory or predictive models.




04. **Tableau - Classification**
   Creation of a dashboard to represent the information
   Queries exploring the data through Tableau
